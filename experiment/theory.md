### Bulking of fine aggregates(sand) is a phenomenon in which the volume of sand increases when some amount of moisture is added to it. It depends upon the particle type, size and the amount of water content. Finer is the sand, more will be the bulkage.  

### It is necessary to determine the bulking of sand before using it at the construction site. Sand is mixed with concrete to fill up the pores and empty spaced and avoid segregation. Thus, this experiment gives us an overview of the bulkage value of sand. 

### Bulking of sand is likely to alter the W/C ratio in concrete mix, hence making it harsh and difficult to use.
